Introduction
Arrays are one of the foundational data structures in Java, and mastering them is crucial for any Java developer. In this repository, I've worked on a series of exercises to practice handling arrays and improve my Java skills. These exercises are an important part of my journey toward becoming proficient in Java programming.

Exercises
1. 2D Arrays
Q1: Store the temperatures for 7 days in 3 cities using a 2D array. Then, use a nested for-each loop to print the average temperature of each city.

Q2: Given a 2D array int[][] matrix, write a method transpose(int[][] arr) that returns the transpose of the matrix.

2. Array of Objects
Q1: Create a Book class with title and author. Store 5 books in an array and use a for-each loop to print details of all books.

Q2: Create a Student class with fields name and marks. Write a method findTopper(Student[] students) that returns the student with the highest marks.

3. Passing Arrays as Methods
Q1: Write a method printEvenNumbers(int[] arr) that takes an array as input and prints all even numbers using a for-each loop.

Q2: Write a method double calculateAverage(int[] marks) that accepts an array of marks and returns the average. Call this method from main.

4. Returning Arrays from Methods
Q1: Write a method int[] squareArray(int[] arr) that returns a new array where each element is the square of the corresponding input element.

Q2: Write a method char[] getVowels(String input) that returns an array of all vowels in a given string.

5. Jagged Arrays
Q1: Create a jagged array with 3 rows where:

Row 1 has 2 columns

Row 2 has 4 columns

Row 3 has 3 columns

Fill it with integers and print using nested for-each loops.

Q2: Write a method double[] rowAverages(int[][] jagged) that returns an array of row-wise averages for a given jagged array.
